# Basic Nested Forms

## Objectives

1. Construct a nested params hash with data about the primary object and a belongs to and has many association.
2. Use the conventional key names for associated data (association_attributes).
3. Name form inputs correctly to create a nested params hash with belongs to and has many associated data.
4. Define a conventional association writer for the primary model to properly instantiate associations based on the nested params association data.
5. Define a custom association writer for the primary model to properly instantiate associations with custom logic (like unique by name) on the nested params association data.
5. Use fields_for to generate the association fields.

## Data model

Let's say we're writing an address book.

Each Person can have multiple addresses. Addresses have a bunch of address info fields.

Our data model looks like this:

  * Person
    * a person has many addresses
    * person.name: string
  * Address
    * an address has one person
    * address.street_address_1: string
    * address.street_address_2: string
    * address.city: string
    * address.zipcode: string
    * address.address_type: string

## Creating people

How do we write our Person form? We don't want to require our user to first create an address, then create that person. That's annoying. We want a single form for a Person containing several slots for addresses.

Previously, we wrote setters like `Song#artist_name=` to find or create an Artist and connect them to the song.

That won't work here, because an address contains more than one field. In the `Artist` case we were just doing the `name`. With `Address` it's "structured data". All that really means is it has multiple fields attached to it. When we build a form
for it, the form will send a different key for each field in each address. This can get a bit unwieldy so we generally try to group a hash within the params hash – makes things much neater. Spoiler: Rails has a way to send this across as a hash.

The complete `params` object for creating a person will look like the following. Using "0" and "1" as keys can seem a bit odd, but it makes everything else work moving forward. This hash is now more versatile. You can use it like an array by just doing `params[:addresses_attributes][0.to_s]` or like a normal hash.

```
{
  :person => {
    :name => "Avi",
    :email => "avi@flombaum.com",
    :addresses_attributes => {
      "0" => {
        :street_address_1 => "33 West 26th St",
        :street_address_2 => "Apt 2B",
        :city => "New York",
        :state => "NY",
        :zipcode => "10010",
        :address_type => "Work"
      },
      "1" => {
        :street_address_1 => "11 Broadway",
        :street_address_2 => "2nd Floor",
        :city => "New York",
        :state => "NY",
        :zipcode => "10004",
        :address_type => "Home"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notice the `address_attributes` key. That key, is similar to our `artist_name` key that we had before. Last time we handled this by writing a `artist_name=` method. In this case we are going to do something *super* similar. This time, instead of writing our own `addresses_attributes` method, we are going to let Rails take care of it for us. We are going to use `accepts_nested_attributes_for` and the `fields_for` FormHelper.

Last time, we first wrote our setter method in the model. This time let's modify our `Person` model to `accepts_nested_attributes_for :addresses`

```ruby
class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :addresses
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :addresses

end
```

Now open up `rails c` and run our `addresses_attributes` method that was created for us by `accepts_nested_attributes_for`.

```ruby
2.2.3 :018 > new_person = Person.new
 => #<Person id: nil, name: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>

2.2.3 :019 > new_person.addresses_attributes={"0"=>{"street_address_1"=>"33 West 26", "street_address_2"=>"Floor 2", "city"=>"NYC", "state"=>"NY", "zipcode"=>"10004", "address_type"=>"work1"}, "1"=>{"street_address_1"=>"11 Broadway", "street_address_2"=>"Suite 260", "city"=>"NYC", "state"=>"NY", "zipcode"=>"10004", "address_type"=>"work2"}}
 => {"0"=>{"street_address_1"=>"33 West 26", "street_address_2"=>"Floor 2", "city"=>"NYC", "state"=>"NY", "zipcode"=>"10004", "address_type"=>"work1"}, "1"=>{"street_address_1"=>"11 Broadway", "street_address_2"=>"Suite 260", "city"=>"NYC", "state"=>"NY", "zipcode"=>"10004", "address_type"=>"work2"}}

2.2.3 :020 > new_person.save
   (0.2ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.8ms)  INSERT INTO "people" ("created_at", "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?)  [["created_at", "2016-01-14 11:57:00.393038"], ["updated_at", "2016-01-14 11:57:00.393038"]]
  SQL (0.3ms)  INSERT INTO "addresses" ("street_address_1", "street_address_2", "city", "state", "zipcode", "address_type", "person_id", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)  [["street_address_1", "33 West 26"], ["street_address_2", "Floor 2"], ["city", "NYC"], ["state", "NY"], ["zipcode", "10004"], ["address_type", "work1"], ["person_id", 3], ["created_at", "2016-01-14 11:57:00.403152"], ["updated_at", "2016-01-14 11:57:00.403152"]]
  SQL (0.1ms)  INSERT INTO "addresses" ("street_address_1", "street_address_2", "city", "state", "zipcode", "address_type", "person_id", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)  [["street_address_1", "11 Broadway"], ["street_address_2", "Suite 260"], ["city", "NYC"], ["state", "NY"], ["zipcode", "10004"], ["address_type", "work2"], ["person_id", 3], ["created_at", "2016-01-14 11:57:00.405973"], ["updated_at", "2016-01-14 11:57:00.405973"]]
   (0.6ms)  commit transaction
```

This is a bit hard to read, but you'll notice that we have a method called `addresses_attributes=`. You didn't write that, `accepts_nested_attributes_for` wrote that. Then when we called `new_person.save` it created both the `Person` object and the two `Address` objects. Boom!

Now, we just need to get our form to create a `params` hash like that. Easy Peasy. We are going to use `fields_for` to make this happen.

```ruby
# app/views/people/new.html.erb
<%= form_for @person do |f| %>
  <%= f.text_field :name %>
  <%= f.fields_for :addresses do |addr| %>
    <%= addr.label :street_address_1 %>
    <%= addr.text_field :street_address_1 %><br />

    <%= addr.label :street_address_2 %>
    <%= addr.text_field :street_address_2 %><br />

    <%= addr.label :city %>
    <%= addr.text_field :city %><br />

    <%= addr.label :state %>
    <%= addr.text_field :state %><br />

    <%= addr.label :zipcode %>
    <%= addr.text_field :zipcode %><br />

    <%= addr.label :address_type %>
   <%= addr.text_field :address_type %><br />
 <% end %>
<% end %>
```

The `fields_for` line gives something nice and english-y. In that block are the fields for the addresses. Love Rails.

Load the page up and see the majestic beauty of what you and Rails have written together. What!!!! Nothing is there.


## Creating stubs

We're asking rails to generate `fields_for` each of the Person's addresses. But
when we're first creating a Person, they have no addresses. Just like  `f.text_field :name` will have nothing in the text field if there is no name, `f.fields_for :addresses` will have no addresses fields if there are no addresses.

We'll take the most straightforward way out: when we create a Person in the
PeopleController, we'll add two empty addresses to fill out. The final controller
looks like this:

```
class PeopleController < ApplicationController
  def new
    @person = Person.new
    @person.addresses.build(address_type: 'work')
    @person.addresses.build(address_type: 'home')
  end

  def create
    @person = Person.create(person_params)
    redirect_to people_path(@person)
  end

  private

  def person_params
    params.require(:person).permit(:name)
  end
end
```

Now, refresh the page and you'll see two lovely address forms. Try and hit submit and it isn't going to work. One last hurdle. We have new param keys, which means we need to modify our `person_params` method to accept them. Your new `person_params` should now look like this:

```ruby
  def person_params
    params.require(:person).permit(
      :name,
      addresses_attributes: [
        :street_address_1,
        :street_address_2,
        :city,
        :state,
        :zipcode,
        :address_type
      ]
    )
  end
```


## Avoiding duplicates

One situation we can't use `accepts_nested_attributes_for` is when we want to avoid duplicates of the row we're creating.

In our address book app, perhaps it's reasonable to have duplicate address rows. Like, both Jerry and Tim live on 22 Elm Street, so there are two address rows for 22 Elm Street. That's fine for those purposes.

But say we had a database of Songs and Artists. We would want Artist rows to be unique, so that `Artist.find_by(name: 'Tori Amos').songs` returns what we'd expect. If we want to be able to create Artists while creating Songs, we'll need to use `find_or_create_by` in our `artist_attributes=` method:

```ruby
# app/models/song.rb
class Song < ActiveRecord::Base
  def artist_attributes=(artist)
    self.artist = Artist.find_or_create_by(name: artist.name)
    self.artist.update(artist)
  end
end
```

This looks up existing Artists by name. If it doesn't exist, one is created. Then we update an artist's attributes with the ones we were given. We could choose to do something else, if we didn't want to allow bulk assigning of an artist's information through a song.

Note that `accepts_nested_attributes_for` and setter methods (e.g., `artist_attributes=`) aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. It's important to evaluate the needs of your specific use case and to choose the approach that makes the most sense. Keep in mind, too, that setter methods are useful for more than just avoiding duplicates — that's just one domain where they come in handy.
